    <string name="top_tips">
        1. Review your constitution\n
It’s really important you review your constitution regularly: it is your governing document and tells you how your
organisation must be run so make sure it is fit for purpose before planning any projects or applying for funds.\n\n
2. Do your homework\n
Always read the funder’s guidelines and the information on their website about work they’ve supported in the past
        and what they want to fund. It might sound obvious but often groups or organisations spend a lot of time applying
        to funders who have specific criteria or aims that they don’t meet.\n\n
3. Plan ahead\n
Preparing applications and going through the process can take a number of weeks, if not months. Many
funders will have deadlines throughout the year so diarise when you need to submit your application and give
        yourself plenty of time from applying to when you need the funds in place.\n\n
4. Be specific\n
Make sure to answer the basic questions clearly and concisely when describing your work and how the
        funds will be spent: Why is it needed? Who will benefit? How many will benefit? How will they benefit?
        Where will it take place? What will happen if the project doesn’t take place? How will you evaluate your success?\n\n
5. Get your facts and figures right\n
Make sure your application is fact based and your numbers add up. Specify all costs and break down the
figures so that the funder understands where you have got your numbers from and include quotations and
estimates rather than approximate figures or guessing how much things will cost. \n\n
6. Get in \n
Many funders will be pleased to hear from you once you’ve read through their guidelines- if you have
questions and to discuss your application. It shows that you are keen to work together and
        what they are looking for and also gives the funder the chance to learn more about the work that you do.\n\n
7. Make sure you’ve enclosed all the documents requested\n
You’ll normally be asked to share a copy of your constitution and your annual accounts along with other
supporting documents and policies. This is a great way of showing your organisation’s credibility,
        that your finances are properly managed and that you adhere to any applicable guidelines for example Vulnerable
        persons Policy. \n\n
8. Check, check and check again!\n
Compare your application with the funder’s guidelines and make sure you’ve answered all of the questions and
addressed all points. Make sure your spelling and grammar are correct too.\n\n
9. Ask someone to read your application\n
It’s a great idea to ask someone outside the organisation to have a read through your application –
        many things that may be obvious to you might be difficult to understand or vague to someone unfamiliar with your work.
        If they can understand the proposal then it’s likely the grant assessor will too. CVS Falkirk is happy to review applications
        and offer guidance with funding applications.\n\n
10. SUCCESS!\n
You’ve secured the funds – congratulations. The work doesn’t stop here though! Remember to record any
statistics, case studies, photographs etc. that you need for your monitoring report and submit it before the deadline.
        It’s really important to meet the funder’s conditions of grant and could help with future funding bids\n
